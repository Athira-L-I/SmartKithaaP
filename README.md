Given how the Internet has grown, with so much information available, it is important to be able to aggregate large amounts of data and make some sense of it. 
This PHP Project uses Amazon Product Advertising API (version:2013-08-01) and Flipkart Search Query Based On Keywords API 1.0 to access the product catalogs from Amazon and Flipkart Databases. This is a search and price comparison engine that will help students compare the prices of textbooks at online shops, simplifying the hunt for the cheapest price possible.
